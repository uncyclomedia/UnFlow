# UnFlow

UnFlow is a project by the [Uncyclomedia Foundation](http://uncyclomedia.co/) to replace the current DPLForum extension used on our projects.

The extension is still in a development phase and major changes should be expected. If you have any questions or are interested in contributing, find one of us in [#uncyclopedia](irc://chat.freenode.net/#uncyclopedia) and we'll be glad to help.
